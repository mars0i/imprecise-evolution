    number of dists in the nth distlist = (length tranmats)**n for one 
    initial distribution.  e.g. with
    two transition matrices and one initial distribution,
       T.at distlists 1
    will produce 2**1 = 2 dists.  Or with more initial distributions, the
    number of dists at n is (length init_dists) * (length tranmats)**n . *)
